# cluster-CMB-lensing
The codes I wrote as part of internship under Dr Kaustuv Basu's supervision

## deflection_angles.ipynb
In this notebook, we explored the deflection angle profiles around a cluster of given mass present at a certain redshift. We began with discussing two-dimensional deflection angle space around Coma cluster which was followed by the comparison of the deflection profiles by varying the redshift. Then we saw the difference of profiles coming out of two deflection formulae from the literature. Finally, we studied the lensing profiles of NFW and SIS galaxies.

## CMB.ipynb
Now, we placed a cluster of a given mass and redshift in front of CMB temperature field and extract the deflection signal. We first placde the cluster in front of constant gradient CMB map and then we replaced this map with the map for L-CDM cosmology.
